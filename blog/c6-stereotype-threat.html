      <div id="blog-title"> Stereotype Threat</div>
      <div id="date"><a> 10/26/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body"><   What I am discussing here is a topic called Stereotype threat. What I want to do is define it, and then give some of my own thoughts on it.<br><br>From the things I have read on it so far, I would describe stereotype threat as the potential negative outcome (I didn't want to say threat again) of judements based on race made by oneself and others. To me, although what I just said is correct, it is vague and abstract. I think the examples are better. It can happen to any group relative to another. Some of the cited research explains where women drive less and peform worse because they are not supposed to be good drivers, in another example, white males perform worse on math when they are explicitly compared to asian males who are supposed to be better at math. Another example is black students doing worse academically at a school where there are lots of white students. Stereotype threat is something that happens when one group is compared to anther and the group that is "supposed" to perform worse does because that is what their stereotype says they are supposed to do.<br><br>
        Regarding my own thoughts: they are developing and I will have to contriubte to them later. At this point, the concept makes sense to me. It reminds me of soemthing I read that said the defining cause of the 21st century is human rights. I think this is relevant because what we are talking about is making sure everyone has the same human rights and access to the same opportunities.<br><br>Being a philosophy major (see I just executed a stereotype threat-y concept by defining myself in one way, maybe not negatively though, depending on your perspective), there is always a broader question in my mind, in this case, the question I think that is lurking in the back ground is: what does it mean to live a meaningful life and how do we acheive it and help others acheive it.<br><br>Lastly, I think this concept reiterates the importance of finding activities to do that can re-create and reshape your identity to keep yourself fresh and evolving. I'll grant I might be projecting a bit on that last one.
