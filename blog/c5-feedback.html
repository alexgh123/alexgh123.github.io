        What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?<br><br>
        I think pairing with another person is a great way to exchange ideas and learn new things in a very smooth way. Almost passivley.<br><br>
Was something particularly fun or rewarding?<br><br>
It is a very simple, but also very useful, the "cmd + /" key stroke comments out blocks of text, love that<br><br>
Was something frustrating and difficult for you?<br><br> Something that is frustrating for me is spending too much time on a problem and not recognizing that is what I am doing. <br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
How did you feel when you read your feedback?<br><br> Because of my personality, I love feedback. I imagine some people can feel very negative and self conscious about it, that is not the case for me. I love it and get disapointed if I do not think it is realistic, or sometimes even harsh enough.<br><br>
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?<br><br> The most helpful feedback is what I can improve on. In one case, it was loops and iterations.<br><br>
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?<br><br> Reading more of the well grounded Rubyist for lots of topics.<br><br>
How was it to write feedback?<br><br> For me, I sometimes struggle because I can be very critical. I do not think I am judgemental, but I know I want the most negative advice, so I can get better at my weaknesses. I project that onto others, when in fact, they were really good.<br><br>
