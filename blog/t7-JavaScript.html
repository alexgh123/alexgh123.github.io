      <div id="blog-title"> Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</div>
      <div id="date"><a> 11/2/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body"><   Hello blog readers, Today we will be looking at Hashes in Ruby and Object in Javascript. The goal is to talk about the similarities and differences between them At a high level, they are the same thing.  In non programming words, we have something like a book; In that book, we have chapters. The chapters are represented by a number (chapter 1,2,3...) and then all of the information associated with that chapter (the actual text). So a hash in ruby or an object in javascript is like the book. In the book, we have the chapters and then all the information associated with each chapter. In ruby, when using a hash, there are 'key-value pairs'. The key is an identifying item (like a chapter number), and a value is information connected to that key (the information in the chapter). In Javascript, the object is the book, the property is the chapter number and the value is the content of the chapter.

      <br><br> With that explanation of what we are talking about out of the way, we will now talk about the differences. First, the syntax is different
      <br><br>
      ```javascript
          var terah = {
          name: "Terah",
          age: 32,
          height: 66,
          weight: 130,
          hairColor: "brown",
          eyeColor: "brown"
          }
      ```

    <br><br>

    '''ruby
        hash {
         a => 0
         b => 1
         c => 2
         d => 3
         e => 4
         }
    '''
      </div>
