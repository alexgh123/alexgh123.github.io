      <div id="blog-body"><   So I want to talk about recursion because I don't understand it really well, so I am going to share some thoughts that can help illuminate the concept.
        <br><br>First, as I was procrastinating, I came across this twitter article from y combinator twitter: http://home.olympus.net/~7seas/recurse.html. I'll hyperlink this latter, just copy and paste. It is something to compare the concept of programming against.
        <br><br> So, stright from the wikipedia page, here is what they say: "The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions." [3]
        <br><br> I'm always suspicious of defining things by just copy and pasting definition because I'm not convinced anyone is absorbing anything (I'm mostly concerned about myself here). So, in my own words, recursion is the concept of using a computer program to run an unspecified amount of times to calculate an unspecified amount of things. For example, my fibonacci sequence program this week worked with fibonacci numbers. Because the number sequence never ends, you need to be able, at least in theory, to have the program go on forever. For this reason, you need recursion. Even more simply, the general concept of programming is that computers are good at doing a lot of very simple tasks repeatedly, something humans are not good at. For this reason, recursion is very important. Without recursion, programming would not be as useful.
