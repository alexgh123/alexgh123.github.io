      <div id="blog-title"> Privacy does Matter!</div>
      <div id="date"><a> 10/11/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body"><   The problem I wish to address and talk about is about why privacy is important in the tech world (its the industry thats collectively violating it) and why even YOU should care about it
<br><br>
Why privacy is important and matters to you:
<br><br>
First, I think a great real world example that is very relevant is the funding of the cyberdust app by Mark Cuban. Basically it is snapchat, but encrypted and the information doesn’t leak. After the snap chat leak in the news in the past few days, he has gotten PR. However, the reason he is putting money into is because he wanted a way to not have anything he has every said to be used against him. Basically, as far as all information indicates currently, he was the victim to the SEC trying to charge him for insider trading where there were no grounds for it. One of the ways the SEC tried to build their case is to take things he said a long time ago in texts, emails, etc. and take them out of context. The SEC took things he said in the past and tried to use it against him in dishonest ways.
<br><br>
Further, having privacy allows for personal growth. One of the reasons people are able to grow, live a meaningful life and reinvent themselves is because they find ways to explore new parts of their identity in a supportive environment. In the news, practicing Islam can put you under suspicion of a lot of people, and in some cases it is warranted, but Islam is a very legitimate religion and it might be right for some people to pursue it. Their pursuing of that religion can help them lead a productive and meaningful life. In a less high minded example, people often go to Las Vegas and do things that they would otherwise not do, often times people realize they do not want to continue to do the things they did in Las Vegas. In a very real way, these people have the privacy they need to experiment and grow with their lives and continue to grow as an individual. Finally, all of this has an evolutionary undertone to it as well. Mutations in genetics can have good and bad consequences, but any changes in our biology is because of a mutation. These mutations, the ways the body experiments in its makeup, allow the human to grow and optimize its system.
<br><br>
Finally, I need to address a very real retort I’m sure you might be saying to yourself, the “well, I have nothing to hide”. And I will use the help of Falguni A. Sheth, a professor of philosophy and political theory at Hampshire College in her article “You don’t have nothing to hide, how privacy breaches are quietly controlling you“. Basically her response to the ‘nothing to hide argument is this:
<br><br>
“But that translation only works if you have never been the object of false suspicion. Because, as we all know, all the   information in the world doesn’t, can’t, always explain another person’s line of thinking. It may not matter to someone whose   identity has never been subject to scrutiny — by police, by customs agents, by the TSA, on the U.S.-Mexico border, at routine   roadside traffic stops, by campus police late at night — where and how the state collects their data. But for someone who already senses that they seem suspicious to the state merely because of what they look like — because they seem to resemble our public impressions of terrorists or violent criminals or scary people — such collection of data also has the effect of limiting my actions: I’d better not surf this website because I’m not sure how the NSA will interpret it. I’ll stop talking to friends outside the local mosque because I know the FBI is spying on it, and I don’t want to appear suspicious and risk being pressured to become an informant. Even though I — like my blond, white friends — have   nothing to hide.”
<br><br>
To me, that is a pretty good argument against the ‘nothing to hide’ argument. Her last thought and the last one I will leave you with is this: personal exploration, creativity and dissent don’t lead to smooth functioning of society, however we don’t need society to function completely perfectly because it isn’t perfect. It needs the disruption to continue to improve.
<br><br>
So, those are some of my thoughts on privacy and why it does matter. I’d love to hear thoughts on it, especially if you disagree with any of the above points.
