      <div id="blog-body"><   I'm here to write about good and bad questions: My task is to analyze questions I have written in the past, and answer: What characteristics make up a good question? and Were there any common characteristics in the questions that did not get answered?  I will also include my theory of "The Commandments" of questions. Lastly, I will espouse some personal thoughts on the topic.<br><br>

        Well, first, in retrospect, I think I have written pretty bad questions so far, and I have even done worse: I have answered questions poorly. The reason I think I have written bad questions is because I haven't followed what I think are "The Commandments" for good questions. Those commandements would be: 1. Make a good specific title to your question. 2. Give background and explain your problem. 3. State your problem, specifically. 4. Show the relevant portion of your code. 5. Maybe reiterate what you want answered. <br><br>
        The reason I have answered a question horribly is because I have seen questions asked and I respond by simply posting a link. I do this, I imagine, because I am lazy and don't want to invest more time. I think the better thing to do would be to actually answer the question in text, give a code example and then give a link to back up my answer.<br><br>

        Personal thoughts: I think you have to make the person understand you. That seems really basic and not helpful, but you have to do it more than you think because the other person is in a completly different world. Another way to put this, is if you want the person that is not wearing you shoes to answer the question, put yourself in their shoes and think what would make them want to answer the question. In a word, be, empathetic.<br><br>
        That is all, thank you for reading.
