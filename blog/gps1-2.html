            <p>At its most basic, pair programing is when two people working together on programing software. It consists of a driver and a navigator. The relative skill level of the two people is not critcal for the success of the pairing</p>

            <p>Pair programing is important because it speeds up the programing process. It is also important because it encountering new information less daunting. It also helps prevent errors from being made.</p>

            <p>The main distintion between driver and navigator is that the driver decides how thing should be done and the navigator implements thier ideas and provides feadback.  This allows the driver and navigator to see each others perspective and gain new insight into problem solving.</p>
