        <p>Padding, Margin and Border are three concepts used in website design that are related to fromatting. More specifically, they refer to concepts used the in the programing language CSS.</p>
        <p>CSS and HTML are two programing languages that can be used to make websites. The two languages work together. They address the form and function of a website. HTML organizes the actual content of site, the function. CSS organizes the layout of the website, the form.</p>
        <p> With that said, we can now return to the three CSS concepts padding, margin and border. As should be clear, these three concepts deal with the layout of the website. Now, before reading further, think about a website you really like. There are probably design elements that contribute to you liking it. Keep this website in mind.</p>
        <p>All HTML/CSS websites are organized in the box model. This sounds vague and confusing, but it really just means that any 'thing' that goes on a website fits in there in box format. For example, if there are pictures, paragraphs and a list of links on a webpage, they all have to be organized in squares and rectangles on the web page. See image below. </p>

        <p> Now that you can understand the box model, we can fit in Margin, Padding and Border. The three terms refer to the formating that go around the box. The border is most straightforward. It will be the border of any of the boxes. The next two are more complicated, padding and margin, because they are harder to see. See image below.

        <p>Essentially, padding is the space between the content (the paragraph, picture, etc) and the border. You can adjust it to stylistic purposes. It is literally 'padding' between the words/content and the border. </p>
        <p>Lastly, the margin is the space between the border and the next box or object on the web page. It is a buffer zone. It is invisible, but keeps space between the content it is associated with and the rest of the things on the web page.</p>
