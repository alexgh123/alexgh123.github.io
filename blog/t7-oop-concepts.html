      <div id="blog-title">OO vs. Functional Programing</div>
      <div id="date"><a> 10/26/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body"><   The question we will be investigating today is the differences between functional and object oriented programmming. Up to this point, we have been working with Ruby, which is an object oriented language. Before I do any more research, I predict that object oriented programming will be more suited to qualitative aspects, like consumer websites, while functional programing will be more similar to a language that can handle mathmatical concepts. (I'm going to read a little bit and then get back to this blog entry...)<br><br>
        ----------------------------------------------------
        <br><br>
        So, I'm back. The debate doesn't seem that articulate from my research so far, even though it doesn't seem to be a complex argument inspite of me understanding it. Generally, given my research, it looks like object oriented programming is a way to abstract a more dominant kind of programing called procedural programing. Given that computers are based on electrodes that turn on and off, I think, at their most fundamental level, computers are procedural. I bring this up, because I think it informs how computers work and how the constitutive parts will work. In other words, I agree that object oriented programming is just a way to abstract procedural concepts. <br><br>
        So, back to the question of how they are different. Functional programing is more in line with procedural programing, while object oriented programing takes some of the burden off the human mind by abstracting some of the annoying procedural concepts that are not as intuitive to a human.<br><br>
        This conversation isn't over, but the last thoughts as I work on this topic I will leave you with is this: First, generally it seems OO can support theoretical organization of information, while fucntional programming might be better for manipulating data in a more procedural way. Lastly, In my research, one comment on an article said something along the lines of, "I don't like this dichotomy because there is no reason you can't use both, they are not really really mutually exclusive".
