        <br><br>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone.<br><br> I had an emotional conflict with someone when my college roomate would not clean up after himself. He would leave his dishes in the sink and never clean them up <br><br> What was it about? What happened?<br><br> See above.
        <br><br>What was the source of the conflict?<br><br> Differing ideas of how clean a kitchen should be, there could have been other souces as well, but it happened years ago.
        <br><br>How did you handle that conflict?<br><br> I would ignore it, and ask him to clean up after himself ocasionally.
        <br><br>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?<br><br> Both, sometimes it would get clean, others not.
        <br><br>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<br><br> I wouldn't do anything different, it was college and very few of my friends, if any were as clean as what I wanted at the time.
        <br><br>What did you learn from this experience?<br><br> It is more important to me to have a clean kitchen, than have someone specifically clean it.
