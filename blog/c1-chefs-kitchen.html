      <div id="blog-title">Cultural Blog 1!!!<br>Kitchen or the Table?</div>
      <div id="date"><a>9/15/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body">Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

Based on the video, the DBC experience matches what I have seen observed so far. That is a good thing and I am excited about it. To use the metaphor given, I was very good and disciplined about being at the kitchen in terms of finding ways to get into the software development industry. Because all of my past educational experiences have been very traditional and more "table" like, I might have started to slip into a table/consumer mindset. This blog is good, because I did not realize it was happening until the dichotmoy was explained.
I am very excited about the collaborative environment for learning on site. I know, personally, I could potentially not be as engaged learning by myself, however I have time management techinques thanks to DBC to manage that.
Another thought I have on this: I played a lot of sports as a child all the way to collegiate lacrosse. The learning environment is different there than in the class room for many reasons. The reason I bring it up, is I think those experiences will help me learn and think about learning in different ways. I think the team sports environment is a more realistic way to learn and I always enjoyed learning where there was always tons of feedback (I lvoed getting yelled at on the field) also there are specific goals in mind. It seemed like a much more realistic learning environment. I see this more realistic learning environment at DBC.
