      <div id="blog-body"><   Thinking style: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential.
<br>
I am without a doubt a sequential thinker. People often tell me, when I explain what I am thinking how it seems very clear. I attribute that to being sequential in the abstract and concrete sense.
<br>
<br>
One problem I have with the sequential side of my brain is that, similar to a computer, sometimes I will run into an “error” and will not be able to continue thinking past it. My mind will obsess over a problem and won’t move on.
<br>
<br>
I don’t think it is based on the Gregoric thinking style model, but I know my myers brig type indicator says I am perceiving (as opposed to judging) which manifests itself in me sometimes procrastinating at the ends of tasks. I like to continue to think about things and not make a decision. This is making it hard to finish my cultural blog at the end of the week.
<br>
<br>
When thinking about a growth and fixed mindset, the first thing that comes to mind is that using the Gregoric thinking style index is enforcing the fixed mindset theory. The reason I say that is because it is telling you how you think, and implicitly that you can’t change it.
<br>
<br>
The thought of working on being more well rounded in the context of growth and fixed mindset and Gegroic thinking styles is interesting to me. On the one hand, some people say, you shouldn’t worry about being well rounded, you should just export your weaknesses to others. With that said, however, I know the ways you engage your brain daily affect how it functions. To this degree, I think programing enforces my natural thinking style. One way to improve my non sequential thinking, and I have heard it is good for life, is to take an improv class. Given that I live in the city that invented improv, Chicago, it shouldn’t be that hard.
