Ok, programing n00b (the audience I am supposed to be writing to for this assignment). I’m going to explain the enumberable cycle method to you. Basically, when you are using ruby to write programs, this method will help you go through a data set repeatedly if you like. We are going to use an example to think about it.
<br><br>
Imagine you have a list of all the flavors and calorie counts for Baskin Robins ice cream, all 31. Your have your list stored in a hash, so a key and a value to represent each flavor. The key might be 0 for the first ice cream calorie count and use the word zero for the first ice cream flavor name. (Yes I know ice cream has calories, but the sake of the example, we’re doing ‘cal free’ and we aren’t using regular flavor names, we’re using the string/word that corresponds to the flavor. So the ice cream with 0 calories is called zero… all the way to thirty-one/31.
<br><br>
So with that data, maybe we are out of some flavors or ice cream, but we need to know the highest calorie count still in the hash of ice cream flavors, and maybe there are duplicates. A way we can do this is the cycle method. The cycle method will go through a list of information, such as our array, and paired with another command such as picking the highest number, could return the sorted list of information.
<br><br>
So, what the cycle method does is repeatedly go through a list of information unless you specify that you only want it to cycle through a specific number of times. It could be helpful going through lists of information, of if you pair it with a destructive method, you could recursively change some information.

exmple_array = ["a", "b", “c”, “d”, “e”]
example_array.cycle { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, d, e, a, b, c, d, e.. forever.
example_array.cycle(2) { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, d, e, a, b, c, d, e
      </div>
