      <div id="blog-body"><   One value I have is Achievement, it is important to me because it allows me to be calm and accept life. I have to acheive/do things every day for my mental health.

Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:
<br><br>
In general, I try to live up to these values:
<br><br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
<br><br>
accomplishment 5, achievement 5, autonomy 4, decisiveness 4, credibility 4, excellence 4 , faith 3.5, health 3.8, integrity 4.5, knowledge 4, leadership 4, empathy 3.5

The last topic someone asked me advice on was my opinion regarding lacrosse.
<br><br>
I feel good when I think about my values. It could help mediate stereotype threat if I recognize or feel it.

Other exercises I can use to help me when feeling down are: exercise, meditation, talking to family, writing a list of things that ares stressful.

I don’t think the “Explain how to use affirmation to help you succeed” learning competency was really directly addressed. I will explain it here: Basically, people will refuse to accept information, input or interactions that threaten their self-esteem (more specifically, the integrity of their self image). When people are presented with information that threatens their self esteem, they do not accept the information. However, if you can remind them of their self esteem in an unrelated area of their life, such as a volunteer organization, they will be more open to the information that might make them feel bad about themselves.
