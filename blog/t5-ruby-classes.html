      <div id="blog-title"> What are classes and when do we use them?</div>
      <div id="date"><a> 10/20/14</a></div>
      <div id="blog-body">< The way I'd like to address this question of class is with two topics in the real world. First, if you would like, please check out this link to a related topic that will set the stage for the conversation:
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/homonym-homophone-homograph/">Words that sound the same, but are different</a>
        <br>
        So, now that you have read that (and if you didn't, no big deal), we are going to use an example, of two words that sound the same, but are different. The two words are: "pray" (the mental act I perform at church) and "prey" (the pursued object of hunting). These two words can provide an example of how class is used in coding.
        <br><br>
        Essentially, what classes do in coding is give context to specific methods (things you want a program to do) in your code. The classes specify when a particular piece of code might be used.
        <br><br>
        So, back to the "pray", and "prey". We are going to say that "pray" and "prey" are pieces of code that can be put into classes. We are going to make two classes (pretend you are coding) that would include these two pieces of code. We need to think of a class, a bigger context, that would include those two things. Well a class called "being a human and interacting" could work, but realistically, that too broad. A more realistic class for "pray" might be something like "things I do on Sunday". A realistic class for "prey" might be under the class of "hunting."
        <br><br>
        We have these two classes, "things I do on Sunday" and "hunting". Before I go further, I'd like to point out that we are dealing with a verb (pray) and a noun (prey). This is important in maintaining consistency with the example and what reality is. If our two pieces of code are a verb and a nount, then within the class, they are going to be different things to. One will be an action/program (like a verb), and the other will be a thing(noun,). On the coding side, we are going to call "prey" a variable because it is a thing that can act or be acted upon.
        <br><br>
        In our class "things I do on Sunday", the "pray" piece of code might have some preconditions such as "go to church", "stop talking" etc. But the important part when understanding classes is that the "pray" piece of code is only used when the context of "things I do on Sunday" is occuring. I do not pray if it is not Sunday.
        <br><br>
        For the "prey" variable in the "hunting" class, it is used a little differently from the verb "pray". In the hunting class, there might be a program called "shoot gun at" that brings up actions such as loading the gun, aiming, etc. Well, it is just an action and needs a variable. That variable is "prey". There might also be a "find prey" piece of code. The point I want to make here is that the variable "prey" can be used lots of different ways in the "hunting" class, outside of the class, we might not want to use it that much.
        <br><br>
        I hope the next question you have is, well because we never use the two words "prey" and "pray", why do we need to seperate them? Well because there might be times when we need to use both. For example, we might be hunting on a sunday, in which case, it would get very confusing when speaking out loud about the prey we want to kill and also pray-ing about not getting killed. When we read words, we can tell the difference between these two things, however when speaking there is not a phonetic difference, that why we have an almost imaginary system of class in the real world: we call it context. Up to this point, the context of the two words in the examples was very clear, and it would have been if I was talking as opposed to typing.
        <br><br>
        This still leaves us with a problem, if we are typing and can tell the difference between the two words, then why do we need to seperate them in the first place? Well, the answer is because we might have two pieces of code that are spelled the same and do the same thing, but when the context changes, what they need to do is different. For example, "making a sandwhich" at church will require differnt actions than "making a sandwhich" on Sunday. For example, while hunting, I will reach into my backpack for supplies, while on Sunday, I will go to my fridge. In this way, the program "making a sandwhich" needs to stay within its class, so it knows how to make a sandwhich.
        <br><br>
        So, that is my explanation of classes, I hope you feel as though you were in class, and I was the teacher and you learned a great deal. Some programmers might even think you have more class for knowing a little bit more about part of their world.
